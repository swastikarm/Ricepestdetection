Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a system that can automatically identify and locate pests in images of rice grains. This is achieved by:

Cloning and setting up the YOLOv7 repository.
Downloading a custom dataset for pest detection from Roboflow.
Training a YOLOv7 model on the custom dataset.
Evaluating the trained model.
Deploying the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and see the detection results.
Setup and Installation
The project is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment. The following steps are covered in the notebook:

Clone YOLOv7 and Install
